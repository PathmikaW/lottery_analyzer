## 3. Statistics Files

### mahajana_summary_statistics.json

Contains 6 sections:

- Dataset info (208 draws, Mar-Oct 2025)
- Number frequency (chi-square p=0.0734 → random)
- Letter frequency (25 unique letters)
- Basic statistics (mean=4.73, median=5.0, mode=6.0)
- Odd/even stats (avg 3.08 odd, 2.92 even → balanced)
- Prize statistics (13 tiers, avg 0.94 jackpot winners/draw)

### govisetha_summary_statistics.json

- Same structure as Mahajana
- 4 numbers from 1-80 range
- Mean=41.36, balanced odd/even distribution

### Frequency Tables (CSV)

- **mahajana_number_frequency.csv** - Numbers 0-9 sorted by frequency
- **govisetha_number_frequency.csv** - Numbers 1-80 sorted by frequency

## 4. Key Findings

### Randomness Confirmation

- Chi-square test: p=0.0734 > 0.05 → **Lottery is statistically random**
- Sum distributions follow normal curves
- Odd/even ratios are balanced

### Pattern Analysis

- **Consecutive pairs:** 91.3% of Mahajana draws contain consecutive numbers
- **Odd/even:** Most common is 3:3 (33.7%) for Mahajana, 2:2 (36.5%) for Govisetha
- **Hot/cold:** Descriptive only, not predictive

### Prize Insights

- **Mahajana Tier 1:** Rs. 2.5M, 47% of draws have winners
- **Govisetha Tier 1:** Rs. 2M, harder to win (4 from 80)
- Inverse relationship: easier tiers = more winners but lower prizes

## 5. Statistical Validation

**Chi-Square Test Results:**

```
Most frequent: 6 (146 times)
Least frequent: 0 (98 times)
Difference: 48 occurrences
p-value: 0.0734 > 0.05
Conclusion: Within normal random variation
```

**Probability:**

- Mahajana: 1/210 chance to match all 6 numbers
- Govisetha: 1/1,581,580 chance to match all 4 numbers

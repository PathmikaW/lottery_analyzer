# Trained Models

This folder stores trained machine learning models.

## Models (will be created in Phase 3)

- `logistic_regression.pkl` - Baseline Logistic Regression model
- `random_forest.pkl` - Baseline Random Forest model
- `catboost_model.cbm` - CatBoost classifier
- `best_model.cbm` - Best tuned CatBoost model (after hyperparameter tuning)

## Model Files

Models are saved using:
- **scikit-learn models**: `.pkl` (pickle format)
- **CatBoost models**: `.cbm` (CatBoost binary format)

## Loading Models

```python
# Load scikit-learn models
import pickle
with open('models/logistic_regression.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    lr_model = pickle.load(f)

# Load CatBoost models
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier
model = CatBoostClassifier()
model.load_model('models/catboost_model.cbm')
```

## Note

Large model files (>.cbm, *.pkl, *.joblib) are ignored by git (see .gitignore).
Models can be regenerated by running the training scripts/notebooks.
